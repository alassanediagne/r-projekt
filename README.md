# R Projekt SS 2024 - Thema 6 - Clustering

## Development flow

- Load current package with `devtools::load_all()` or `Ctrl-Shift-L` this loads the package into the current R-Session. AFTERWARDS test the written functions in the console. Don't add `library` and `source` calls to the Codebase. Maybe this [cheat-sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/package-development.pdf) is helpful.

## TODO 

- [x] Remove all `requirements` and `library` calls. 
- [x] Remove all `source` calls. 
- [x] Check that the packages lodes, atm something like this happens
  ```
  Error in `load_all()`:
  ! Failed to load R/optics.R
  Caused by error:
  ! object 'irisPetals' not found
  ```
- [x] Make sure all`@exported`Â¸ methods have helpful roxygen comments
- [x] Make sure all Tests pass successfully
- [x] Implement hierarchical clustering
- [x] Replace magrittr pipe calls where possible with native ones
- [x] Add some helpful `stops`
- [ ] Make sure all methods use the same data in- and output format, we ended up not doing this because many algorithms work differently


### At the end

- [x] Remove all commented code; this is bad style
- [x] Build package release
- [x] Check `DESCRIPTION` file: Add authors etc.

### Before each release

- [ ] Check documentation is up to date generate with `devtools::document()`
- [ ] Run tests with `devtools::test()` or `Ctrl-Shift-T`
