# R Projekt SS 2024 - Thema 6 - Clustering

## Development flow

- Load current package with `devtools::load_all()` or `Ctrl-Shift-L` this loads the package into the current R-Session. AFTERWARDS test the written functions in the console

## TODO 

- [ ] Remove all `requirements` and `library` calls. 
- [ ] Remove all `source` calls use: Imports, Depends, or Suggests; there's also `usethis::use_r()`
- [ ] Check that the packages lodes, atm something like this happens
  ```
  Error in `load_all()`:
  ! Failed to load R/optics.R
  Caused by error:
  ! object 'irisPetals' not found
  ```
- [ ] Make sure all methods use the same data in- and output format
- [ ] Make sure all`@exported`Â¸ methods have helpful roxygen comments
- [ ] Make sure all Tests pass successfully
- [ ] Implement hierarchical clustering
- [ ] Replace magrittr pipe calls where possible with native ones

### At the end

- [ ] Remove all commented code; this is bad style
- [ ] Build package release


### Before each release

- [ ] Check documentation is up to date generate with `devtools::document()`
- [ ] Run tests with `devtools::test()` or `Ctrl-Shift-T`
